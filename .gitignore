# --- Project Specific ---

# Ignore all CSV files within any subdirectory of StateData
# This will ignore your voter files and CVAP files if they are CSVs.
StateData/**/*.csv

# Ignore all files and subfolders within the results directory
results/

# If you still want to track the empty directory structure for results (e.g., results/CA/, results/FL/)
# but ignore all files within them, you could do:
# results/**/*
# !results/**/
# !results/*/.gitkeep
# (And then add an empty .gitkeep file in each state's results subfolder you want to track as an empty dir)
# However, simply ignoring `results/` is more straightforward if you don't need to track the empty dirs.

# You might still want to track your shapefiles if they are not too large,
# or if they are essential for others to run the code without finding them separately.
# If shapefiles are also too large, you can ignore them too:
# StateData/**/*.shp
# StateData/**/*.dbf
# StateData/**/*.shx
# StateData/**/*.prj
# (and other shapefile components)
